This program will fetch all the password which has been leaked. Although these passwords are hashed with the SHA1 algorithm.

It's going to look in the database of pwnedpasswords.com and find all the passwords which match the first 5 characters of generated SHA1 hash value of the password which you give as argument and tell if the same given password has been hacked or not.
